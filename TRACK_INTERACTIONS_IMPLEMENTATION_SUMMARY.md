# Track Interactions Fix - Implementation Summary

## ðŸŽ‰ Successfully Implemented Features

### âœ… 1. Track Like/Unlike Functionality
- **Database**: Created/verified `user_likes` table with proper foreign key relationships
- **API Endpoints**: 
  - `POST /api/tracks/[trackId]/like` - Like a track
  - `DELETE /api/tracks/[trackId]/like` - Unlike a track
- **Frontend**: 
  - Heart icon shows **green** when track is liked
  - Clicking already liked track does **nothing** (as requested)
  - Optimistic UI updates with error rollback
- **Database Integration**: Uses existing `user_likes` table with `entity_type='track'`

### âœ… 2. Play Count Tracking
- **Database**: Added `play_count` column to `tracks` table with proper indexing
- **API Endpoint**: `POST /api/tracks/[trackId]/play` - Increment play count
- **Frontend**: 
  - Play count increments when track is played
  - UI updates to show new play count immediately
  - Integrated with existing music player functionality

### âœ… 3. Audio Duration Extraction
- **Library**: Installed `music-metadata` for real audio file processing
- **Implementation**: Updated `getAudioDuration()` function in `/api/tracks` route
- **Functionality**: 
  - Extracts real duration from MP3 and M4A files
  - Stores duration in both seconds and MM:SS format
  - Fallback to 3:00 default if extraction fails
  - Error handling for corrupted files

### âœ… 4. User Liked Tracks Retrieval
- **API Endpoint**: `GET /api/users/[userId]/liked-tracks` - Get user's liked tracks
- **Features**:
  - Pagination support
  - Includes track details and metadata
  - Sorted by most recently liked
  - Proper error handling

## ðŸ”§ Technical Implementation Details

### Database Schema Changes
```sql
-- user_likes table (already existed, verified structure)
CREATE TABLE user_likes (
  id INT PRIMARY KEY AUTO_INCREMENT,
  user_id INT NOT NULL,
  entity_type ENUM('track','album','playlist','blog_post'),
  entity_id INT NOT NULL,
  created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
  FOREIGN KEY (user_id) REFERENCES users(id) ON DELETE CASCADE
);

-- tracks table enhancement
ALTER TABLE tracks ADD COLUMN play_count INT DEFAULT 0 NOT NULL;
CREATE INDEX idx_tracks_play_count ON tracks(play_count DESC);
```

### API Endpoints Created
1. `POST /api/tracks/[trackId]/like` - Like a track
2. `DELETE /api/tracks/[trackId]/like` - Unlike a track  
3. `POST /api/tracks/[trackId]/play` - Increment play count
4. `GET /api/users/[userId]/liked-tracks` - Get user's liked tracks

### Frontend Components Updated
1. **TrackListItem.tsx**: 
   - Green heart icon for liked tracks
   - Prevents action on already liked tracks
   - Optimistic UI updates
2. **Album Page**: 
   - Integrated like/unlike functionality
   - Play count tracking on track play
   - Real-time UI state management
3. **Track Upload**: 
   - Enhanced with real audio duration extraction

## ðŸ§ª Testing Implemented

### Database Tests
- `database-migration-track-interactions.js` - Database schema setup
- `test-track-interactions.js` - Database operations testing

### API Tests  
- `test-complete-track-interactions.js` - Complete API functionality testing

### Manual Testing Checklist
- [x] Heart icon turns green when track is liked
- [x] Clicking already liked track does nothing
- [x] Play count increments when track is played
- [x] Audio duration extracted from uploaded files
- [x] User liked tracks can be retrieved
- [x] Error handling works correctly
- [x] Optimistic UI updates with rollback

## ðŸš€ How to Test

### 1. Start Development Server
```bash
cd audiosphere
npm run dev
```

### 2. Test Database Operations
```bash
node test-track-interactions.js
```

### 3. Test API Endpoints
```bash
node test-complete-track-interactions.js
```

### 4. Manual Frontend Testing
1. Navigate to album page: `http://localhost:3000/albums/1`
2. Click heart icon on a track (should turn green)
3. Click same heart icon again (should do nothing)
4. Play a track (play count should increment)
5. Upload a new track (duration should be extracted)
